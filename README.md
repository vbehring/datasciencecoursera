This is the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

### How does it work

Initally it loads the needed library.

It them reads all the needed files and creates a data set to "test" and other to "train".

It merges the to data sets in one data set

After this merging operation, it creates a data set containg only the std and mean colunms

Based on this last created data set, it summarizes each column, grouped by subject ans saves the result to a tidy.txt file

### Observation
